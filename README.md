**Expert machine learning and deep learning techniques for developing smarter IoT systems**

## What is this book about?
There are many applications that use data science and analytics to gain insights from terabytes of data. These apps, however, do not address the challenge of continually discovering patterns for IoT data. In Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for IoT, we cover various aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implementation to make your IoT solutions smarter.
This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Apply different AI techniques including machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras
* Access and process data from various distributed sources
* Perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning for IoT data
* Implement distributed processing of IoT data over Apache Spark using the MLLib and H2O.ai platforms
* Forecast time-series data using deep learning methods

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
A = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, None, name='A')
B = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, None, name='B')
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

If you are a data science professional or a machine learning developer looking to build smart systems for IoT, Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for IoT is for you.
